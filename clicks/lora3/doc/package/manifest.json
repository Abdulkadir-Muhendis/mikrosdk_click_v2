    "short_description": "LoRa 3 click is a LoRa® technology-based SRD transceiver, which operates at a sub-gigahertz frequency of 868MHz. Thanks to the spread spectrum modulation feature, as well as the low power consumption, it is capable of achieving a long-range communication, immune to interferences. This click board™ features a complete LoRa® stack onboard: it implements physical, network and MAC layers, allowing for easy operation via the UART interface.",
